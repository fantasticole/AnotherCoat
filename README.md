This Twitter bot randomly picks a nail polish color from a JSON file and tweets the brand, color name and which collection that color is from.


When I decided that I wanted to create a Twitter bot, I wasn't sure what it should tweet. I ended up deciding to do nail polish colors because some brand give them fun names!

While looking for the information to populate the data file, I learned about scraping web pages and how to properly format data to be traversed later.
